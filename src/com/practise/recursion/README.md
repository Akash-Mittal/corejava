# Factorial

A Simple yet Effective Way to learn Recursion.

## This Artifact should be able to answer these questions.

* What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Using recursion ?
* How to Get the Factorial of a Very Large Number ?
* How to fasten Test Driven Development ?

---
## The Following Program Consists of:

1.) Simple `Recursive` Implementation With Primitive Type of `int`. 
2.) `Iterative` Implementation to support `big-data` using `BigDecimal`.
3.) `Recursive` Implementation to support `big-data` using `BigDecimal`.

## Learnings:

* `Recursion` is a Program Calling itself to do same task.
* The said task should be identical in nature.
* The Current Task completion is dependent on Previous task.
* The BigDecimal Was Used to very Large Numbers.
* Primitive `int` will be able to calculate till 12! only. 

### Disadvantage

* Cannot do validations, or simply put the Recursive function will call itself
  , when it does any Validations like `if not null` will be executed.
  
* Keeping that as an assumption it is safe to say that `Recursive Functions` are

	  * Dependent or on the Mercy of Calling Function for Validation Checks.
	  * If you are brave enough to put `not null`, good  luck with your coding career :-.
